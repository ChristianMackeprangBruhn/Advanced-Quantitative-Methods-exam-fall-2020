# Advanced-Quantitative-Methods-exam-fall-2020
Exam about presidential ads in the 2008 presidential election.

For the exam in this course, we had to reproduce the core results of a published study by using a different dataset. We based our analysis on Jonathan Krasno and Donald Green's paper 'Do Televised Presidential Ads Increase Voter Turnout? Evidence from a Natural Experiment' (2008). Here, they analyzed whether presidential tv ads had an effect on turnout in the 2000 election. To reproduce their findings with new data, we focused on the 2008 presidential election.

The exam had 4 instructions:

1) Reproduce and present the results from a published article of your choice with a different dataset. Explain how this dataset captures the concepts that the original study was interested in, and insofar as the exact procedure cannot be replicated with the new dataset, explain why the replication nevertheless informs us about the original study’s object of inference.

2) Discuss the extent to which your results are similar or dissimilar from those in the original study.

3) If possible, extend the original analysis in a theoretically and methodologically informed manner. This can be done in a variety of ways, e.g. by estimating uncertainty differently, or testing whether the analysis of theoretically informed sub-groups would affect the original conclusions.

4) Discuss the study’s limitations, and how they matter for the inferences that we can draw from it. Suggest potential and realistic changes to the design that would allow for more credible inferences.
